  For programmatically generating AccessTokens and Valid TwiML (plus using the REST APIs)


### TwiML Apps

You can create a TwiML App in the Twilio Console: **Voice > Manage > TwiML apps**

You can use [the REST API to create them, too](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api/applications#create-an-application-resource)

## Tips

There is a separation between what the SDK methods provide, what TwiML does to call behavior, and the Call Resources that Twilio creates with each call. The Call instance provided by the SDK provides some insight and functionality into the underlying Call resource, but it does not provide the same functionality as the Call Resource. You can still modify and monitor the status of the Call Resource via the REST API. 

Make sure you're keeping track of your Call instance and that your UI interactions are affecting that specific Call instance. 

SSR frameworks (Vite, Nuxt, Next.js) will require that you dynamically import the JS SDK library into your project. Some of the polyfills may require some dynamic imports as well.

Some frameworks' reactivity will not like the `call` and `device` objects. You can save these as normal variables, rather than in reactive properties/state/whatever so you avoid constant re-rendering.

## Troubleshooting 

* Open your browser console
* Pass logLevel: 1 in your Device options when creating the Twilio Device
* Read the Call Logs in your Twilio Console
    * Look at the Request Inspector section and confirm that Twilio is receiving the correct TwiML instructions. If not, check where Twilio sent the request. Is your TwiML App's Voice Configuration URL set correctly?
* Read the Error Logs in your Twilio Console
* Debug your AccessToken at jwt.io
