### TwiML

* [Helper Libraries (Server-side SDKs)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries)  
  For programmatically generating AccessTokens and Valid TwiML (plus using the REST APIs)


### TwiML Apps

You can create a TwiML App in the Twilio Console: **Voice > Manage > TwiML apps**

You can use [the REST API to create them, too](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api/applications#create-an-application-resource)



## How does my SDK end user dial a phone number?

### Relevant documentation

* [Device ConnectOptions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/javascript/twiliodevice#connectoptions)
* The [Voice JavaScript SDK Quickstarts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/javascript/get-started) also contain examples of this behavior.

In order for an end user to dial a specific number, you will need to pass the information from the client side (i.e. the phone number) to your TwiML endpoint on the server side. You do this by passing an argument containing the information to the device.connect() method. 

`device.connect()` accepts one argument, a "ConnectOptions" object, which can contain a `params` property. The `params` value must be an object containing key/value pairs of your custom information. 

### Example:

An end-user inputs "+15558889999" in a form on the front end. 

Set this phone number in your ConnectOptions object's `params` property. 

Your JavaScript file:

```js
const connectOptions = {
  params: { 
    numberToDial: "+15558889999"
  }
}

let call = await device.connect(connectOptions);
```

Your TwiML endpoint that handles outgoing calls can access this custom `numberToDial` parameter within Twilio's request body. You can then use the `numberToDial` value when creating the TwiML that you send back to Twilio. 



## Tips

There is a separation between what the SDK methods provide, what TwiML does to call behavior, and the Call Resources that Twilio creates with each call. The Call instance provided by the SDK provides some insight and functionality into the underlying Call resource, but it does not provide the same functionality as the Call Resource. You can still modify and monitor the status of the Call Resource via the REST API. 

Make sure you're keeping track of your Call instance and that your UI interactions are affecting that specific Call instance. 

SSR frameworks (Vite, Nuxt, Next.js) will require that you dynamically import the JS SDK library into your project. Some of the polyfills may require some dynamic imports as well.

Some frameworks' reactivity will not like the `call` and `device` objects. You can save these as normal variables, rather than in reactive properties/state/whatever so you avoid constant re-rendering.

## Troubleshooting 

* Open your browser console
* Pass logLevel: 1 in your Device options when creating the Twilio Device
* Read the Call Logs in your Twilio Console
    * Look at the Request Inspector section and confirm that Twilio is receiving the correct TwiML instructions. If not, check where Twilio sent the request. Is your TwiML App's Voice Configuration URL set correctly?
* Read the Error Logs in your Twilio Console
* Debug your AccessToken at jwt.io
